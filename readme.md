## Descriptions

### [Sunday Long Run](https://github.com/mgriffin/running-routes/blob/master/sunday_long_run.geojson)

The longest loop that we do as a club in the Phoenix Park. It's approximately 16km (10 miles) and takes in most of
the park. It starts at the top of the steps in Islandbridge and heads over to the main road before crossing it and
skirting the edge of the Zoo at the Polo Grounds.

Continue up past the front of Áras an Úachtarain and around the edge in the direction of the Hole in the Wall pub.
Keep to the edge of the park and cross over the main road again at the Castleknock gate. Continue on until you reach
White's Gate and go around the Ordnance Survey in a clockwise direction. You will reach the wall of the park again and
follow it until you can see the Knockmaroon Gate. Turn left here and through the forest at the Furry Glen. You can 
either go down into the Glen and back up the steep hill or choose to skip this and skirt along the top. Follow the road
until you get to a set of S bends. Continue straight along the track that veers off the main path. This will bring you
down the hill to the edge of St mary's Hospital. 

Take a left here up the gully and at the top, continue to the right, following the track. Cross over a road and keep
following the track that will bring you up to the 15 Acres. Once on the acres, take a right and head towards the
Magazine Fort. One lap around the fort and back on to the acres again, heading towards the Papal Cross.

Before the road, turn right and cross over the top of the Kyber Pass road. There is a track that goes beside a short
bit of a wall and on in the direction of the main road. Follow the main road all the way to the cricket grounds and 
turn right to finish off.

Don't forget to look out for the deer and appreciate the calm in the middle of the city.
